## Have a bug?

When reporting, please provide the following:

 1. What version of `github-review` are you using? (If you cloned from the repo
    and it's up-to-date, you can just say "latest master branch")
 2. What exact command did you run? (ex.
    `$ review.js https://github.com/dthree/cash/pull/71/files`)
 3. What output did you see (and where did it get stuck)? If possible, please
    copy-paste the output, and
    [format using a code block](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code)
 4. What's your OS? Do you have curl installed? What version of node are you
    using? etc.
 5. Any other info you think might be important

Thanks!
